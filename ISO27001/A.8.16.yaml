title: Monitoring Activities
checklist_items:
  - id: A8.16.1
    description: Is there a documented monitoring policy defining the scope, objectives, and responsibilities for monitoring activities?
    type: manual
    help_text: The policy should specify what is monitored (e.g., systems, users, traffic), monitoring frequency, responsible roles (e.g., IT, SOC), and alignment with risk management objectives.

  - id: A8.16.2
    description: Are all critical systems, networks, applications, and endpoints included in the monitoring scope?
    type: manual
    help_text: Maintain a list of critical assets and confirm their coverage in monitoring dashboards. Include on-prem, cloud, remote access, and mobile endpoints where relevant.

  - id: A8.16.3
    description: Are key activities, such as access attempts, configuration changes, and suspicious behavior, actively monitored?
    type: automated
    help_text: Monitor key events such as failed logins, privilege escalation, configuration file edits, and suspicious process launches. Validate coverage across platforms.

  - id: A8.16.4
    description: Are appropriate monitoring tools (e.g., SIEM, IDS/IPS, endpoint detection tools) deployed for real-time and historical analysis?
    type: automated
    help_text: Use tools like Splunk, ELK Stack, Sentinel, Suricata, Snort, or CrowdStrike. Ensure logs and events are collected from all infrastructure layers and retained for trend analysis.

  - id: A8.16.5
    description: Are tools configured to generate alerts for predefined thresholds or suspicious events?
    type: automated
    help_text: Define alert rules for high-failure authentication attempts, excessive traffic, known malware indicators, or system performance anomalies. Validate alerting logic regularly.

  - id: A8.16.6
    description: Are alerts prioritized based on severity and responded to within defined timelines?
    type: manual
    help_text: Implement an alert severity model (e.g., informational, warning, critical) and link each severity to required response times and escalation paths in the incident response plan.

  - id: A8.16.7
    description: Are logs and events from different sources correlated to identify patterns or anomalies?
    type: automated
    help_text: Use SIEM correlation rules to detect coordinated attacks or multistep anomalies. Cross-reference logs from firewalls, endpoints, IAM, and cloud platforms.

  - id: A8.16.8
    description: Are monitoring activities centralized in a dedicated monitoring platform or Security Operations Center (SOC)?
    type: manual
    help_text: Use a centralized interface (e.g., SOC, NOC, or managed detection service) to unify visibility and streamline triage, escalation, and threat hunting activities.

  - id: A8.16.9
    description: Are key system and network performance metrics monitored to ensure operational health (e.g., CPU, memory, disk usage)?
    type: automated
    help_text: Use performance monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Zabbix, CloudWatch) to track system load, latency, resource consumption, and network uptime. Set thresholds for alerts and logging.

  - id: A8.16.10
    description: Are monitoring activities aligned with regulatory requirements and standards (e.g., GDPR, ISO 27001)?
    type: manual
    help_text: Confirm that monitoring complies with privacy and legal obligations. Include log anonymization or consent-based monitoring where required under GDPR or local law.

  - id: A8.16.11
    description: Are monitoring activities integrated with the incident response process to facilitate timely investigation and resolution?
    type: manual
    help_text: Ensure monitoring outputs feed into incident response workflows. Alert triage, investigation, and response actions should be documented and linked to incident records.

  - id: A8.16.12
    description: Are monitoring logs preserved for forensic analysis during incidents?
    type: manual
    help_text: Retain monitoring logs in tamper-resistant storage for at least 6â€“12 months. Use versioning or secure storage to ensure log integrity. Link retention to incident response and audit use cases.
