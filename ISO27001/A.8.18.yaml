title: Use of Privileged Utility Programs
checklist_items:
  - id: A8.18.1
    description: Is there an up-to-date inventory of all privileged utility programs in use (e.g., administrative tools, diagnostic utilities)?
    type: manual
    help_text: Maintain a documented inventory of all utilities that allow privileged actions (e.g., registry editors, packet sniffers, backup tools). Include version, location, and owner.

  - id: A8.18.2
    description: Is access to privileged utility programs restricted to authorized personnel only (e.g., using role-based-access)?
    type: manual
    help_text: Use RBAC, Active Directory groups, or PAM solutions to restrict access. Assign access based on job function and enforce least privilege principles.

  - id: A8.18.3
    description: Are multi-factor authentication (MFA) and strong password policies enforced for accessing privileged utilities?
    type: automated
    help_text: Require MFA for all administrative tools and consoles, including CLI and GUI access. Enforce complex passwords with expiration and reuse prevention policies.

  - id: A8.18.4
    description: Are approvals required before granting access to privileged utility programs?
    type: manual
    help_text: Implement an access request workflow where managers or system owners must approve elevated access. Retain records of requests and justifications.

  - id: A8.18.5
    description: Are all activities performed using privileged utility programs logged and monitored?
    type: automated
    help_text: Capture session logs, command execution logs, or screen recordings where possible. Integrate logs into SIEM or auditing systems for real-time and retrospective analysis.

  - id: A8.18.6
    description: Are privileged utility programs restricted to predefined tasks and systems?
    type: manual
    help_text: Limit tools to authorized hosts and use cases. Disable or uninstall unused utilities on non-admin systems. Use allowlists or PAM rules for runtime restrictions.

  - id: A8.18.7
    description: Are procedures in place to grant temporary access to privileged utilities for specific tasks?
    type: manual
    help_text: Define time-limited access workflows using tools like Just-In-Time (JIT) access provisioning or expiring group memberships. Require clear justification for temporary elevation.

  - id: A8.18.8
    description: Are privileged utility programs configured securely to prevent misuse (e.g., disabling insecure features)?
    type: manual
    help_text: Review tool configurations to disable risky or legacy features (e.g., unauthenticated access, scripting interfaces, remote debugging). Harden with vendor best practices or security benchmarks.

  - id: A8.18.9
    description: Are changes to privileged utility programs (e.g., updates, installations) reviewed and approved through a formal change management process?
    type: manual
    help_text: Apply change control procedures for adding, removing, or updating utilities. Review for impact, test in non-production, and document approvals in the change log.

  - id: A8.18.10
    description: Are employees with access to privileged utilities trained on secure usage practices and the risks associated with misuse?
    type: manual
    help_text: Deliver role-specific training covering secure tool usage, abuse scenarios, auditing expectations, and incident handling. Refresh training annually or after policy updates.

  - id: A8.18.11
    description: Is access to privileged utility programs reviewed periodically to ensure appropriateness?
    type: manual
    help_text: Conduct quarterly or semi-annual reviews of all users with access to privileged tools. Validate business justification and revoke access that is no longer required.
