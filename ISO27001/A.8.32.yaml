title: Change Management
checklist_items:
  - id: A8.32.1
    description: Is there a documented policy governing the change management process, defining roles, responsibilities, and procedures for requesting, reviewing, approving, and implementing changes?
    type: manual
    help_text: The policy should define change types (standard, normal, emergency), approval workflows, stakeholder responsibilities, and links to incident and configuration management.

  - id: A8.32.2
    description: Are all changes to systems, applications, and infrastructure initiated and documented through a formal change request?
    type: manual
    help_text: Use a ticketing or change management system (e.g., ServiceNow, Jira, GitOps) to record each change request with unique ID, description, priority, and responsible person.

  - id: A8.32.3
    description: Are proposed changes assessed for their potential impact on security, availability, and performance?
    type: manual
    help_text: Evaluate risk, security implications, dependency impact, and potential service interruptions for each change. Document findings in the change request form.

  - id: A8.32.4
    description: Are changes reviewed and approved by authorized personnel or a change advisory board (CAB) before implementation?
    type: manual
    help_text: Require formal approvals before deployment. Involve security, operations, and business stakeholders depending on change type and risk level.

  - id: A8.32.5
    description: Is an audit trail of approvals maintained for compliance and accountability?
    type: automated
    help_text: Maintain immutable records of approvals with timestamps, approver identities, and change metadata. Retain records for audit periods defined in your compliance framework.

  - id: A8.32.6
    description: Are changes tested in a development or test environment before being deployed to production?
    type: manual
    help_text: Mandate pre-production testing for all non-trivial changes. Simulate performance and security impact under realistic conditions prior to deployment.

  - id: A8.32.7
    description: Are detailed implementation plans created for each change to ensure smooth execution?
    type: manual
    help_text: Include change steps, timing, resources involved, communication plans, monitoring instructions, and fallback triggers in each implementation plan.

  - id: A8.32.8
    description: Are rollback procedures defined and tested to revert changes in case of issues?
    type: manual
    help_text: Require documented rollback or backout plans with validation steps. Test rollback procedures in staging environments periodically.

  - id: A8.32.9
    description: Is there a process for managing emergency changes, including expedited approvals and post-implementation reviews?
    type: manual
    help_text: Define a fast-track workflow for urgent fixes (e.g., critical security patches). Require retrospective review by CAB or security team after implementation.

  - id: A8.32.10
    description: Are changes monitored during and after implementation to ensure they do not negatively affect systems or introduce security vulnerabilities?
    type: automated
    help_text: Monitor key metrics (e.g., error rates, resource usage) post-change. Use dashboards, alerts, and automated anomaly detection to identify regressions or incidents.

  - id: A8.32.11
    description: Are affected stakeholders notified in advance about planned changes, including timing and potential impact, to ensure smooth transitions and minimize disruption?
    type: manual
    help_text: Communicate change windows, expected impact, and contact information via email, service portals, or team calendars. Include escalation paths for user-reported issues.
