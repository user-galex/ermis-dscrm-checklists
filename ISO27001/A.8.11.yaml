title: Data Masking
checklist_items:
  - id: A8.11.1
    description: Is there a documented policy defining when and how data masking should be applied (e.g. which data classifications require masking such as personal, confidential, or sensitive data)?
    type: manual
    help_text: The policy should identify data categories that require masking and define use cases (e.g., masking for testing, user training). Include distinctions between irreversible masking and reversible pseudonymization.

  - id: A8.11.2
    description: Is there an inventory of systems and datasets requiring masking?
    type: manual
    help_text: Maintain a data inventory or data flow map that identifies systems processing personal or sensitive data. Flag those requiring masking based on classification and use.

  - id: A8.11.3
    description: Are appropriate data masking techniques (e.g., tokenization, encryption, pseudonymization) applied based on data type and use case?
    type: manual
    help_text: Apply deterministic or random masking, shuffling, nulling, or tokenization depending on whether data needs to remain linkable or statistically useful. Use reversible methods only when necessary and tightly controlled.

  - id: A8.11.4
    description: Are reversible and irreversible masking techniques differentiated and applied accordingly?
    type: manual
    help_text: Use irreversible masking (e.g., randomization) for dev/test environments. Use reversible methods only in production with strict access controls and key management.

  - id: A8.11.5
    description: Are automated tools used to implement data masking?
    type: automated
    help_text: Use tools such as IBM Optim, Oracle Data Masking, or open-source tools integrated into CI/CD pipelines. Automate masking for data exports and sandbox generation.

  - id: A8.11.6
    description: Is access to unmasked data restricted to authorized personnel only?
    type: manual
    help_text: Enforce RBAC and data access governance. Use data access logs and periodic reviews to ensure only authorized roles (e.g., compliance, security) can view or revert masked data.

  - id: A8.11.7
    description: Is data masking enforced for test, development, and staging environments?
    type: automated
    help_text: Use masked datasets when populating non-production environments. Prevent accidental loading of real data into lower-tier environments through DLP or automated deployment rules.

  - id: A8.11.8
    description: Are masking activities logged, including details of when and where masking was applied?
    type: automated
    help_text: Log all masking operations and store logs securely. Include dataset, timestamp, masking method, tool used, and responsible user/service. Retain logs for audit and troubleshooting.

  - id: A8.11.9
    description: Are masking practices aligned with regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA)?
    type: manual
    help_text: Confirm alignment with Article 32 and 25 of GDPR (data minimization, pseudonymization) and/or relevant sectoral laws. Document the legal basis for masking and when unmasking is permissible.

  - id: A8.11.10
    description: Are employees and contractors trained on the importance of data masking and their role in implementing it?
    type: manual
    help_text: Provide role-based training for developers, analysts, and engineers on masking vs. encryption, masking techniques, and when masking is legally required. Include this in data handling or privacy training modules.
